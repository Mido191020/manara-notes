# Coding Interview Process

## 1. Clarifying Questions (1-5 min)
- [ ] Validate understanding
- [ ] State/agree on assumptions
- [ ] Ask about available resources
- [ ] Discuss edge cases

## 2. Example Input
- [ ] Develop medium-sized example
- [ ] Use to confirm understanding
- [ ] Create own even if given one

## 3. Solution Development
- [ ] Start with brute force
- [ ] Discuss complexity issues
- [ ] Iterate to better solutions
- [ ] Seek interviewer feedback

## 4. Coding
- [ ] Write clean, well-indented code
- [ ] Use good variable names
- [ ] Create placeholders for complex helper methods

## 5. Code Walkthrough
- [ ] Use medium-sized example
- [ ] Go through line-by-line
- [ ] Add inline comments for variable values
- [ ] Debug if necessary

## 6. Test Cases
- [ ] Mention importance of unit testing
- [ ] Discuss various scenarios (happy path, edge cases, etc.)

## General Tips
- Treat as a conversation with interviewer
- Explain thought process continuously
- Ask for hints if stuck
- Implement working solution over perfect but incomplete one
- Stay calm if debugging is needed
