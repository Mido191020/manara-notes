# What NOT to Do in an Interview

## 1. Don't Start Coding Immediately
- [ ] Avoid jumping straight into coding without proper analysis
- [ ] Take time to analyze the problem thoroughly
- [ ] Outline your approach and discuss it with the interviewer
- [ ] Identify data structures and algorithms you plan to use
- [ ] Consider time and space complexities (Big O)
- [ ] Agree on the approach with the interviewer before coding

### Why it matters
Starting to code immediately can lead to:
- Missing crucial edge cases
- Overlooking important requirements or constraints
- Lack of clarity in your approach

## 2. Don't Ignore Hints from Your Interviewer
- [ ] Recognize that the interviewer is a resource, not just an evaluator
- [ ] Pay attention to hints or nudges from the interviewer
- [ ] Be open to changing your approach based on feedback

### Why it matters
Ignoring interviewer hints can:
- Result in missing optimizations
- Lead to neglecting specific constraints
- Indicate an inability to collaborate or take feedback
- Potentially translate to poor teamwork in a real-world setting

## 3. [[Don't Be Overly Opinionated]]
- [ ] Avoid insisting on using a particular programming language if another is more suitable
- [ ] Don't rigidly adhere to certain paradigms or design patterns if they complicate the solution
- [ ] Be open to different approaches, tools, and frameworks

### Why it matters
Being overly opinionated can:
- Make you appear inflexible
- Hinder your ability to work in diverse, cross-functional teams
- Limit your problem-solving capabilities

## 4. Don't Use Education as a Primary Qualification
- [ ] Avoid relying solely on educational qualifications
- [ ] Focus on demonstrating practical skills and real-world experience
- [ ] Highlight problem-solving abilities and hands-on projects

### Why it matters
Overemphasizing education can:
- Suggest a lack of awareness of job demands
- Undervalue practical skills crucial in the tech industry
- Misrepresent your ability to handle real-world coding challenges
